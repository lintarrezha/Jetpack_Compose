                    "In the great battle that pitted gods against demons Edras fell, and Volkath turned to the abyss. By his side were Veera and Maloch, the first to join Volkath in his rebellion, and Kahlii, one of the Three Maidens of Veda. Conspicuously missing, however, was Volkath's lover Marja, another of the Three Maidens.\"Would you come with me if I truly turned against the Holy Light?\" Volkath asked Marja before he took the final step.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "\"I will cut off your head and hang it at the top of the temple, to show the world what happens to traitors.\" Marja had wavered between her teacher and her lover, but the call of duty was strong, and eventually she declined Volkath's invitation.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "\"Choice is both a right and a duty, my love. You will understand, in time.\" Volkath whispered in her ear, \"There is no safety in the margin between light and darkness. There is only storm and fury, even if it has yet to rear its head. This is my parting gift for you. You will need it, when the storm comes...\"As he spoke, he lifted Marja's chin and kissed her, a kiss so long that Marja felt out of breath. It was as though she lost something, and gained something at the same time.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "Volkath did not tell Marja that he had gifted her a part of his soul, with which he broke the hold that the Holy Light had on her, and planted the seeds for her transformation. Infinitely patient and confident, he was certain that the woman who he loved would one day accept his ideals, and return to his embrace, to walk again with him side by side. When the Holy Light was tarnished, Lokheim welcomed their new lord. Volkath correctly predicted the political machinations in Veda after Edras' death, with Ilumia banishing Marja. His parting gift for Marja would help her break the shackles of light, and reunite them in the abyss. What Volkath did not count on was that his invasion of Athanor would become his own downfall. With the help of the World Tree, Tel’Annas fell Volkath with a single arrow, sending the Lokheim forces routing back to the abyss. When Marja escaped from prison she was greeted not by her lover with open arms, but a cold, grey tombstone. Marja's fury was terrible. Seeking vengeance on Afata, she sent innumerable Shadow Worms against Afafa, leaving vast areas of lifeless, barren wastelands in their wake. For a hundred years afterwards the forces of Afata never stepped out of their territory, fearful of the threat that Marja posed.\n" +
                    "\n" +
                    "\"Marja, my love. Who could have thought that the parting gift I left for you would become the key to my resurrection?\""
